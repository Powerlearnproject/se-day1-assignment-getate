# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
its a systematic application of principles to the development, design and maintainance of a software
efficieny, it provides solutions to the problem at the most needed time
security, it provides security to data
Complexity, it simplifies problems and makes it easier to manage projects

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of software in 1968 during the Nato software engineering conference
the rise of object orinted programming in 1980s which lead to introduction of concept like classes and objectsmodels and also ecouraged the flexibility
Emergence of agile methodologies in 1990s, to metigate the rigidity of software development


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, this involves defning the project scope
rquirements analysis, all details are gathered to facilitate understanding of the intended goal
design, this is the transalations of the requirements into the blueprints of the software
development, this is where the actual coding is writen based on the specifications
testing, verification of the software
deployment, the actual production of the software
Maintainace, After the deployment the software enters the monitering phase for updates


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
water fall is a linear and sequential approach to software development i.e  while Agile is an interative and flexible approach to software development i.e for customer feedback



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer, analze users needs and design a software to give a solution, recomend system upgrade to customers
Quality assurance Engineer, counterchecks that the software has passed all checks before being released to clients.
Project manager, assigns tasks, evaluate the teams performance and gives guidance throughout the development


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for: streamlining of coding, making the development faster and efficient and navigating coding with ease
VCS it helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as a team, it supports the dynamic, collabortaion environment and providing stability acrose the development projects


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Growing customer demands
changing requiremnts
software testing conflicts
limited infrastrature

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing, testing of the indivual components or units of a software, importance, code quality ensures each unit of coding works correctly, Documentaton, provides documentation on how the unit is supposed to work
Integration testing, involves verification of interactions between different components of a software. importance, data flow, ensures cprrect flow of data in modules
improves reliabiity by ensuring the components functon together
System testing, a fully complete and integrated software product. importance, user perspective, testing the product to ensure it meets the user expectation
end to end testing, validating the entire systems functionality


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engneering is a process of ensuring that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague, how to translate chineese to eglish
Specific, How do we say Good morning in Chineese?
the improved prompt ensures that the AI gives accuarte output
